# Protected Docs

Welcome to Protected Docs â€“ a web application for collaborative document management. This app lets users create private rooms where they can collaboratively work on documents in real time. Each room is password-protected, ensuring that only authorized users can access and edit its contents.

## Features

- Create Rooms: Users can create private rooms by entering a password.
- Real-Time Collaboration: Collaborators within the same room can simultaneously edit documents and see changes in real time.
- Document Management: Users can create, edit, and delete documents within their rooms.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app provides an intuitive interface for smooth navigation and document management.
